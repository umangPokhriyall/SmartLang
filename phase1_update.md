# Smartra DSL - Phase 1 Update

## Progress Summary

During this initial phase, our team has:

- Defined the core grammar for our DSL using ANTLR4
- Created a basic lexer and parser for the language
- Implemented syntax highlighting for the DSL
- Developed a simple AST builder that can represent basic contract structures
- Created example programs in our DSL for token contracts and voting systems

We've completed the initial grammar design which supports:

- Contract declarations with state variables
- Function definitions with modifiers for security checks
- Built-in security patterns (reentrancy guards, overflow protection)
- Event declarations and emissions

## Challenges Faced

We encountered several challenges during this phase:

1. **Grammar Ambiguities**: Resolving parser conflicts when designing a grammar that feels natural yet is unambiguous for parsing
2. **Security Pattern Integration**: Determining how to bake security patterns into the language without making it too restrictive
3. **Type System Design**: Creating a type system that maps cleanly to Solidity while providing additional safety guarantees
4. **Gas Optimization Strategy**: Identifying which optimizations to implement at the language level versus the compiler level

## Next Steps

For the upcoming phase, we plan to:

1. Complete the AST transformer to generate valid Solidity code
2. Implement security analysis passes that block unsafe patterns
3. Add gas optimization transformations for common patterns
4. Create test cases comparing gas usage between DSL-generated contracts and hand-written Solidity
5. Begin work on the documentation and examples
