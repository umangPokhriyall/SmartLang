## Motivation (1 pt)

Smart contracts are powerful but notoriously easy to get wrong. Developers often introduce vulnerabilities like reentrancy or integer overflows due to the complex and low-level nature of Solidity. Gas inefficiency is another major pain point, increasing the cost of deploying and interacting with contracts. Our motivation is to simplify smart contract creation by introducing a domain-specific language (DSL) that enforces secure patterns and compiles into highly optimized Solidity code. By abstracting away unsafe constructs and automatically applying best practices, this DSL will enable developers to build robust contracts with less effort and lower gas costs.

## State of the Art / Current Solution (1 pt)

Currently, most developers write smart contracts in Solidity or, less commonly, Vyper. These languages give great control but also expose developers to pitfalls, such as reentrancy vulnerabilities or inefficient code patterns that lead to high gas usage. Tools like Slither and Mythril help detect issues post-development, and compilers like Solc optimize some patterns—but they do not enforce safe patterns at the language level. A purpose-built DSL can solve this by design, preventing vulnerabilities before they're written rather than detecting them afterward.

## Project Goals and Milestones (2 pts)

### Goals:

- Design a minimal DSL syntax for writing secure and gas-efficient smart contracts
- Implement a compiler that translates the DSL to optimized Solidity code
- Integrate static checks to prevent common vulnerabilities (focusing on reentrancy, integer overflows, and access control)
- Provide usage examples and compare performance (gas usage) against traditional Solidity code

### Milestones (4 Weeks):

- Week 1: Define the DSL grammar using ANTLR4 and develop the lexer/parser
- Week 2: Implement AST generation and basic code translation for ERC20 token functionality
- Week 3: Add security enforcement patterns and static analysis checks
- Week 4: Implement gas optimizations, create test suite, and finalize documentation

## Project Approach (3 pts)

We will design a custom DSL using ANTLR4 as our parsing framework. This DSL will resemble Python for readability while incorporating smart contract-specific constructs. Key features include:

1. **Syntax Design**:

   - Python-like indentation for blocks
   - Built-in decorators for security patterns (e.g., `@reentrancy_guard`)
   - Type annotations with range constraints for numeric types

2. **Compiler Pipeline**:

   - ANTLR4-based lexer and parser
   - Custom AST with semantic analysis
   - Security pattern enforcement via AST transformations
   - Solidity code generation with optimizations

3. **Security Mechanisms**:

   - Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern enforced by default
   - Integer overflow/underflow prevention
   - Automatic access control checks
   - Prevention of common gas-intensive patterns

4. **Gas Optimizations**:
   - Constant folding and propagation
   - Dead code elimination
   - Storage packing optimization
   - Function inlining where beneficial

### Technologies Used:

- ANTLR4 (Parser Generator)
- Node.js for compiler implementation
- Solidity compiler (Solc) for testing output
- Hardhat for smart contract deployment/testing

## System Architecture (2 pts)

```
[DSL Source Code]
        ↓
    [Lexer/Parser (ANTLR4)]
        ↓
 [Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)]
        ↓
  [Semantic Analysis]
        ↓
  [Security Pattern Enforcer]
        ↓
  [Gas Optimizer]
        ↓
  [Solidity Code Generator]
        ↓
  [Compiled Smart Contract]
```

Each stage of the pipeline ensures that unsafe or gas-wasting constructs are identified and addressed before proceeding to the next stage.

## Project Outcome / Deliverables (1 pt)

1. A working DSL implementation with ANTLR4 grammar
2. A compiler that generates optimized Solidity code
3. Example smart contracts (ERC20 token, simple voting system) written in our DSL
4. Benchmark comparisons showing:
   - Gas usage improvements
   - Security vulnerability prevention
   - Code size reduction
5. Documentation with:
   - DSL syntax guide
   - Compiler usage instructions
   - Security pattern explanations

## Assumptions (100 words max)

We assume developers will adopt the DSL if it improves both security and gas efficiency without being harder to use. We will focus on the most common smart contract types (tokens, voting systems) as proof of concept. We assume that targeting Solidity as the output language (rather than EVM bytecode directly) provides a good balance of control and feasibility. We will prioritize critical security features first (reentrancy, overflow protection, access control) and add more advanced features if time permits.

## DSL Sample (Example Syntax)

```
contract TokenContract:
    @safe_math
    state:
        owner: address = msg.sender
        balances: mapping(address => uint256)
        totalSupply: uint256 = 1000000

    @only_owner
    function mint(to: address, amount: uint256):
        balances[to] += amount
        totalSupply += amount
        emit Transfer(address(0), to, amount)

    @reentrancy_guard
    function transfer(to: address, amount: uint256) -> bool:
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance")
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount
        balances[to] += amount
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount)
        return true
```
